		<h4>What is a verified account?</h4>
		<br />
		
		Any user with a green checkmark badge shown on their profile is a verified account.
		<br />

		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h4>What's special about verified accounts?</h4>
		<br />
		Verified accounts let users find an reliable source without the mistake of following a fake user.
		This helps the verified user have their fans, customers, etc. follow them instead of a unofficial source on Fluxster.
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h4>What type of users can be verified?</h4>
		<br />
		Any type really, with certain exceptions of course. We try to keep a look out for users in business, music, media, and other demanding types. These are mainly our top priority to getting around to verify before any other types.
		<br />
		<br />
		Though we do not verify accounts from the general public. Personal use accounts are an example. And requesting for a verification when the account is being used for only personal use may be denied.
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h4>Can my account be verified?</h4>
		<br />
		If you think your account meets the criteria for verification, just please be patiant. We try out best to keep a look out for accounts that show signs in need for verification.
		Yet again, we do not accept requests for verification from the general public. And note that follower count doesn't not determine weither you can be verified or not. 
		<br />
		<br />
		Note the being verified does not give you any special benefits or privileges besides to help with people knowing your account is a official source.
