		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>1.</strong> This is where you type your message in. It's pretty self explanatory from here.
		<br />
		<strong>2.</strong> After you are done typing your message and/or inserting your media, you will press this button for it to be shared on Fluxster.
		<br />
		<strong>3.</strong> This will allow you to post a picture media to your post. Note that this will want to take a picture off of your computer. <br />(Posting a picture via url is not yet available)
		<br />
		<strong>4.</strong> This will allow you to post a video media to your post. This is done via url. (From Youtube and Vimeo Only)
		<br />
		<strong>5.</strong> When you are want to add a video media to your post, you press the video button (4) and this textbox will appear. Here is where you copy & paste your video url. (From Youtube and Vimeo Only)
		<br />
		<strong>6.</strong> This is your message letter count. As you type, it will go down. This shows you how many letters you have left for your message until you can't type anymore. So pay attention to it.
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>@Mentions</strong>
		<br />
		If you are wanting to send a post towards someone, you will use a <font color="#67a59b">@mention</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		Example:
		<br />
		<img src="{$url}/images/welcome_mentions.png" />
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>#Hashtags</strong>
		<br />
		To start a topic or post within a topic, you can use <font color="#67a59b">#hashtags</font>
		<br />
		When posting with a hashtag, your post will be categorized with other posts that had that hashtag aswell.
