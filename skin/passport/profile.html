		Passport is a detailed entry on where your account has been signed into. You have visuals on IPs and the time when it was logged in. 
		<br><br>
		We provide these details so that you can find any suspensions to who is logging into your account other than you.
		
		<br><br>
		NOTE: We only keep two records at a time. The one you are currently logged into and the log in before that.
