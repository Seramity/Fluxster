# Fluxster
## Source of Fluxster

Fluxster was a small social networking website where people can join, share, and follow other people. (Similar to Twitter)
People or businesses were able to use Fluxster to share content, follow users, and have their friends/customers keep up to date.

Anyone may clone this repo and test Fluxster out on their own.

## Installation
In order to test run Fluxster on your own, I recommend downloading a desktop web environment.
For Windows I recommend something like [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
For Mac: [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)\
For all Windows, Mac and Linux: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

1. Install a desktop web environment that suits your needs. (If you are unsure how to do this there are many videos that clearly explain this process)
2. Make a copy of Fluxster into your www folder
3.
